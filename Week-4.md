## In Class

You will need to complete a Project Review for your students before the end of the class.

## Class Tips & Tricks

### Online Profiles

Some students may not pass the Online Profiles assignment for various reasons. After grading the Online Profiles assignment make sure to reach out to any students that did not pass the assignment. Give them direct feedback on what they need to change in order to pass the assignment. Give them a due date to make their changes and to re-submit the assignment so that it doesn't go unnoticed throughout the class.

### Live Coding

Students will struggle with Live Coding problems. Most students have been focused on their coding projects, and haven't done much algorithm style coding. They will forget basic things sometimes. You should review the Live Coding Problems before class so that you have a better understanding of what your students need to do to solve the problems.

Most students will struggle with 1 of 2 things: breaking the problem down into small pieces, or forgetting basic syntax. You can figure out which thing they are struggling with by asking them to describe a solution in psuedocode. If they are able to talk about how they'd solve it, but then struggle it's a syntax issue. If they aren't able to talk about how they'd solve it, it's a breaking the problem down problem.

### Project Review

You will need to perform a project review with each of your students this week. The project review doesn't need to be a long ordeal, you simply need to make sure your student is making progress on their project. Ask them about things they've struggled with so far. You probably won't have time to help each of your students solve a technical issue in each project review. So if students are talking about technical issues, ask them about what they have done to solve that issue. What is their process when they get stuck? Are they asking other students, have they read technical documentation, have they looked for tutorials online, have they googled different versions of the same question? If they haven't tried all of those things, they should. If they are having lots of technical issues it could be a deeper issue of not understanding what they need to do to solve a problem. Have them walk you through what their project should be doing in as fine of detail as possible. If they struggle, they may not know why they are trying to do something they are attempting to do.

### Group Project Activity -- Sprint Retrospective
Activity Length: 30-45 Minutes. 

For group projects, this is a good time to stop and run a retrospective on the last three weeks in place of the code review, and discuss how things have gone so far with the group's project and progress. This is a strange thing to do for new programmers, but practice participating in the process now is helpful for their real placements later on. 

You can use the following simple script to help guide this retrospective. 



Start the retrospective by explaining that the target is to be open, honest and clear about what has gone on in the last four weeks, and what we can do to help guide the project better following the break week. The retrospective is a private space in which the team can examine how its done and what its done in order to improve their results in the remaining time in the class. Explain that normally this would last two to three hours, but in the time we have allotted, and because we aren't working 8 hour days, 30 to 45 minutes will do just fine. 

You will guide the students through answering four questions:
- "What Went Well?"
- "What did not go well?" 
- "What can't we control?" 
- "What can we control and change to improve our next sprint?" 

On a white board or large piece of paper, separate the board into four spaces and write "Triumphs" "Opportunities" "Can't Control" "Changes", one in each quadrant, then read each question aloud for each quadrant and explain a little about what that means to you. 

Finally, read the Prime Directive quote below, and invite the students to be honest with themselves and others for the next few minutes. 

*The Prime Directive*

*"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."

#### What Went Well? 

For this question, ask the students about what went well. Anything that they've been successful with, learned, or had a feel good moment about over the last few weeks. Really focus in on things that will reward them in the coming weeks and their new roles. We use "Triumphs" here because it describes a feeling of runaway success and achieving progress. 

Great examples: 
- Got a new piece of Spring Boot to work. 
- Solved a large problem with multiple team members
- Recognizing other students for successful implementations. 
- Placed into the Apprenticeship Program. 

#### What didn't go well? 

Here, ask students to be honest. What felt like they failed, did not succeed as well as they'd hoped or has really slowed the team's prgress. Don't let students drag on themselves or others, but be constructive about things that they could possibly fix for the next few weeks.

Great examples:
- Could not resolve a database structure/type
- Unable to set aside time to work.
- Did not understand user stories
- Ran out of user stories. 

Keep in mind the point isn't for this to turn into a shouting match, but to identify where the team stumbled. 

##### On Team Conflict

Sometimes, teams will inevitably butt heads during the retrospective process. Gain control of the situation and remind the students that we're looking for problems that we can fix, and people aren't something we can fix in the scope of building our project. Encourage students to rephrase attacking statements into identifiable problems. Give students the chance to calm down if they need to. As the facilitator, you are 100% empowered to end this question early if the team is unwilling to compromise or move forward without attacking one another. 

#### What Can't We Control? 

Now we'll look at the problems identified, and figure out what can't be changed in the scope of the class or with our current skill set. This is more to help eliminate problems that we potentially don't have solutions to or can't solve. This helps students focus on solutions that they can accomplish. 

Examples
- Spring Security not resolved yet
- Can't figure out Javascript. 
- Some complicated API questions. 
- So-and-So is Annoying


#### What Can Improve?

With the remaining opportunities, help the team come up with ways to resolve those opportunities, or improve on their current situation. Help the team understand that they will need to hold each other responsible. It helps to declare whom is going to take the improvement on, and who is going to hold them accountable. 

Examples: 
- Team feels like its losing track of progress. 

   TA runs a daily checkin at an agreed upon time, and helps facilitate daily discussion. 
   
- We are not as far along as we would hope. 

   Team holds a get-together during Break Week to examine User Stories and ensure their size is appropriate, then shows new stories to TA. 

-We have trouble being present at class at the same time. 

   Team agrees on holding Standup before class, and the TA is responsible for taking attendance at that time. 

Over the next few weeks, it will be your responsibility as the TA to help the team remember these adjustments. In Week 8, you will revisit these and talk about how they improved or did not improve. 

## Next Week

No assignments are assigned as homework this week.

Traditionally, Liftoff has a break week after Week 4, and Students are welcome to make a plan of meeting during the week as normal. Extend the team the offer for your presence if they want to meet. 

The team should aim to complete more stories during the week and stay in contact via Slack over the course of the week. 

# Weekly Reminders

Make sure your students are making commits on their projects. If students are blocked make sure they are communicating that to their group mates, don't be afraid to pair students on a problem if progress isn't being made.
