## In Class

You will need to complete a Project Review for your students before the end of the class.

## Class Tips & Tricks

### Online Profiles

Some students may not pass the Online Profiles assignment for various reasons. After grading the Online Profiles assignment make sure to reach out to any students that did not pass the assignment. Give them direct feedback on what they need to change in order to pass the assignment. Give them a due date to make their changes and to re-submit the assignment so that it doesn't go unnoticed throughout the class.

### Live Coding

Students will struggle with Live Coding problems. Most students have been focused on their coding projects, and haven't done much algorithm style coding. They will forget basic things sometimes. You should review the Live Coding Problems before class so that you have a better understanding of what your students need to do to solve the problems.

Most students will struggle with 1 of 2 things: breaking the problem down into small pieces, or forgetting basic syntax. You can figure out which thing they are struggling with by asking them to describe a solution in psuedocode. If they are able to talk about how they'd solve it, but then struggle it's a syntax issue. If they aren't able to talk about how they'd solve it, it's a breaking the problem down problem.

### Project Review

You will need to perform a project review with each of your students this week. The project review doesn't need to be a long ordeal, you simply need to make sure your student is making progress on their project. Ask them about things they've struggled with so far. You probably won't have time to help each of your students solve a technical issue in each project review. So if students are talking about technical issues, ask them about what they have done to solve that issue. What is their process when they get stuck? Are they asking other students, have they read technical documentation, have they looked for tutorials online, have they googled different versions of the same question? If they haven't tried all of those things, they should. If they are having lots of technical issues it could be a deeper issue of not understanding what they need to do to solve a problem. Have them walk you through what their project should be doing in as fine of detail as possible. If they struggle, they may not know why they are trying to do something they are attempting to do.

## Next Week

No assignments are assigned as homework this week. Encourage your students to work more towards their user stories, and to practice for their live coding assignment next week.

# Weekly Reminders

Make sure your students are making commits on their projects. If students are blocked make sure they are communicating that to their group mates, don't be afraid to pair students on a problem if progress isn't being made.
