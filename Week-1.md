# Class Tips & Tricks
## Creating quality User Stories
Remind students to keep their user stories short and sweet. It's okay to work together to create user stories, in fact, we'd suggest to have students create them collaboratively.

## Keeping projects doable
We often find that coming up with a project idea for a group tends to be difficult so we suggest deciding on a concrete way to choose group project ideas. Your students are instructed to come to class with a few ideas but deciding on it is always a chore. Using a voting system with you as the arbitrator is the best bet (don't feel too bad if students aren't happy with the decision, they've signed an agreement stating they may not be building the exact project they want to).
Before class, we suggest coming up with 2-3 ideas of basic CRUD projects (to keep in your back pocket) that you can propose to your group if they cannot otherwise think of a manageable enough project.
It's helpful to remind students that this class is meant to guide them towards creating a marketable project and not the next big thing (per se).

## Git (using, and managing project workflow)
Once your group has decided on a project idea, get in contact with your candidate engagement manager who can then create a project repo on LaunchCode's Liftoff Projects Github account. You'll be added as an admin to the repo. You should get the GitHub usernames of each of your students and add them as collaborators, they should then fork the master. Students should work on a new branch per user story and send a pull request for you to approve. Talk to your students about committing frequently (ideally when they complete a user story). Give them a summary of what their Git workflow will look like.

## The First Scrum

It can be fairly awkward the first time the group gets together for a standup, so here's a modified version of the three questions to help your team get to know each other: 

* When did you complete LC101/How did you get to Liftoff? 
* What were you doing for work prior to Launch Code? 
* What do you want to learn during your Liftoff Project? 

# Objectives
* Your group should leave class having decided on a project idea
* Get your group started on user stories

# Next Week

No assignments are assigned as homework this week. Encourage your students to work on developing user stories, next class we will do wireframing.

# Weekly Reminders

* Have students aim for several User Stories or defined their large Features by the next class. 
  * Encourage students to post their User Stories to the team Slack or Trello Board
  * This lets you review and help guide the story development.
* Group Project Mentors should have a Slack Channel and Trello board set up prior to Week 2.
* Students do not have to wait for week 2 to start coding.
