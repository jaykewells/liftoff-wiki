## Project Reviews
You probably already have an idea of where the group's progress is at. The group will pass the project review with an MVP of their app. User stories should be completed, if your group has already completed, talk to them about possibly deploying their app. Do you have any advice to them for deploying?

Encourage your students to continue learning and building things on their own. What do you think are good resources for doing so? How do you think they should pursue continued self education?


## Group Activity: Sprint Review

To pass the Project Review activity for groups, the team must present their project with a full demo to the TA and Instructor (if available). This allows them to get the experience of showing their work to shareholders, and how to take criticism and suggestions in a professional setting. 

The team will want to go through their presentation and the demo, ensuring that all named features are present and working during the demo. 

As the stakeholder, you should ask questions about any identified upcoming features, and make suggestions of new ones. Per real world experience, you'll want to ask for at least one moonshot feature that is FAR beyond the team's capabilites, and see how they respond. This question is not vital to passing, however is a common real-world scenario. 

Walk through that ask with your team afterwards and explain why and how you would respond to that ask in your current role. Highlight responding appropriately and explaining technical limitations to non-technical people in ways they can grasp. 


# Objectives
* Students complete final project review and course
* Every student should have worked on at 2 user stories during the project cycle.
* Every student in your group should have turned in a resume, online Profile, and 2 project check ins.


# Weekly Reminders

If you have any students who still need to complete Live Coding or Mock Interviews, please direct to try once more with you, the instructor, or the course manager. If they do not pass, they will have to complete these things with the course manager in the following weeks to transition to the apprenticeship program.
