# Class Tips & Tricks
## Minimum Viable Product
It's important to communicate with students the importance of working on actionable points. Many students will have lots of ambition or just have some nebulous ideas on what features they want to build. Communicate with them that they want to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) rather than the most robust thing ever.

The key piece of this conversation is not to minimize the project per se, but thinking about how to most simply implement user stories and features so that they still deliver on the base functionality you're looking for. Remind students that they only have 8 weeks, they don't have to reinvent the wheel with their features and that they shouldn't.

### Mapping the MVP
Students may have trouble understanding what exactly qualifies as an MVP, and Story Mapping may be helpful. 

Lead students through an exercise of listing out their perfect morning routine prior to going to work, and write those steps down in order on a sheet of paper or post-it notes. 

Have them start eliminating items for the following time blocks: 
* I'm 10 minutes late. 
* I'm 30 minutes late.
* I overslept. 

Generally, the MVP of a product is going to fall in the "I Overslept" range. This can help students understand what items to separate out as "Nice to Have's" and what actually makes their project work. 

## Wireframing

When wireframing, remind students that they don't want to be meticulously detailed. The idea here is to get a sense of how your project will be laid out. Have students work together on wireframes, it is a group project, make sure they're working towards a shared vision. 

You may encourage students that are having trouble conceptualizing or scoping their projects complete a cereal box exercise to help pare down their features. You can shorten the following activity to 30 minutes to help account for time.

## The Second Scrum

Being that work may not have occured yet, the standup might still be a bit weird for everyone. If no work has occured, you can expand on last week's questions with the following: 

* If you could pick any type of technology to work on, what would it be? 
* What's a fear you have about the Apprenticeship or the Tech Industry? 
* What's a technology or framework that you want to learn after Liftoff? 

# Objectives
* Finalize the MVP of your group project and what you want the final project to look like
* Build out some wireframes
* Get working on user stories

# Next Week

Keep encouraging your students to work on developing user stories, next class we'll work on some career modules. 

* Have students review existing Online Profiles on Github and LinkedIn if they already have them, and see where they can improve their existing profiles. 
  * Linked In's profile rating is a good guide, encourage students to increase their rating to Rock Star. 


# Weekly Reminders

* Keep working towards completing user stories (primarily creating them at this point), and use wireframes to inform those user stories.
* Ideally, students should have a landing page prior to Week 3, even if there is no functionality. This sets them up for their first feature by Week 4.
