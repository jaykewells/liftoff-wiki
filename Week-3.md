# Class Tips & Tricks
## Online Profiles
Direct students to complete the LaunchCode Branded resume template. Remind them not to change the template! Also remind them to paste with destination formatting (probably shift + paste)! Google Docs also has a "Save a Copy to My Drive" option. 

LinkedIn profiles are great networking tools so talk to students about how LinkedIn can be used to generally make more connections and learn about things. Remind them that a LinkedIn profile is helpful in your future job search. People can sometimes find mentors via LinkedIn so hintiddy-hint-hint.  This is also useful later on in their careers if they are looking for a new opportunity using the "Open to Offers" option on their profile. Encourage students to turn this off while they are looking for an apprenticeship. 

### Online Presence and Social Media

Students should also take a moment to google themselves during this activity and review their social media presence and security settings. Employers can look at public media profiles and make decisions about a candidate's cultural fit with their company based on this. Students should make a conscious decision about how much of their online presence should be visible to employers. This includes Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit and any other platforms where the company has a social media presence. 

If students have a singular online identity, they need to review that username's appearance across all platforms (I.E. if a student is a streamer on Twitch and has a social media presence for that personality). 

Some sites like Reddit track and publicly display their upvotes or likes, and sometimes this feature's visibility can't be controlled.

Additionally, typing their name into google with their "Lives In" city from Facebook can show your passive presence, such as tagging, news stories and other fun facts. 

Students should be made aware that this isn't an active search that companies do, but the "younger" a company is, the more likely that their social media accounts will be reviewed during the hiring process.

## Progress

At this point, you should have your project planning out of the way and have started or should start to actually write code for your project. 

# Objectives
* Complete a resume and LinkedIn Profile
* Complete Project planning
* Start writing code for projects

# Next Week

Really push students to start getting code out, if they haven't they should! The first project review is next class and they'll need to have something running.

# Weekly Reminders

Work towards implementing user stories in code. Get working to complete something viable to pass the project review next week.
