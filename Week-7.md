# Class Tips & Tricks
## Mock Interviews
Today students will have to complete their mock interview (practice interview) with either you, the course manager, the instructor, or a volunteer. Remind them to frame their answers as stories and don't forget the STAR method (it's in their prep work).

## Project Presentation

Students will need to complete a project presentation off of a template provided during class. This will help them talk about their project and is a good example of a portfolio item. 

## Group Activity: Sprint Review Preparation

Next week, groups will want to present their project and demo the project to the TA and Instructor (If available). The team should complete the presentation together. 

As the TA, you should come up with questions that can help the group answer "What's Next?" and think about where they are going during the Sprint Review. Start building these questions this week so you have things to ask next class.

## Rest of Class
Students should continue working towards completing their projects. If you have students who have still not yet completed Live Coding, please take some time to run them through Live Coding.

# Objectives
* Students complete mock interviews
* Work towards completing the project

# Next Week

We will have our final project reviews. Every project should be at least be at an MVP stage.

Remind Groups that they are going to want to have a project that is clonable and can run on each teammember's machine independently of each other. 

# Weekly Reminders

No reminders except that to complete Liftoff, students need to have their projects ready next week!
